# 🔐 AWS re/Start Security Labs

This repository contains hands-on security labs completed as part of the **AWS re/Start** program. These labs focus on implementing, managing, and auditing cloud security using core AWS services. They reflect practical experience with **IAM**, **firewalls**, **monitoring**, and **patch management** — key skills for modern **Cloud**, **DevOps**, or **Security** roles.

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

### 🔑 Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Created and managed **IAM users**, **roles**, and **groups**.
- Assigned **least privilege** permissions using custom policies.
- Secured accounts with **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Implemented **role-based access control** for services and resources.

### 🔥 Network Security & Firewalls
- Configured **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** to manage traffic.
- Applied firewall rules to restrict access to **EC2** and **VPC** resources.
- Troubleshot blocked traffic and misconfigured rule sets.

### 📊 EC2 Monitoring & Patching
- Enabled **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor EC2 instance performance.
- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for CPU and network thresholds.
- Used **AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager** to:
  - Scan EC2 instances for missing updates
  - Automate OS patching across instances

### 🔒 Data Protection & Encryption
- Enabled **encryption at rest** using **KMS-managed keys**.
- Applied **S3 bucket policies** to enforce secure data access.
- Configured **encryption in transit** via HTTPS and TLS.

### 🕵️ Logging & Audit
- Activated **AWS CloudTrail** for API-level logging across regions.
- Used **CloudWatch Logs** to monitor events and system health.
- Traced and reviewed access changes and login events for auditing.
